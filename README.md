### Homework 1: Ruby Calisthenics ###
> This homework will help you to become familiar with the Ruby language and some of its features, such as object-oriented programming (OOP), iterators, metaprogramming and duck-typing.

### Homework 2: Introduction to Rails ###
> In this homework you will clone a GitHub repository ("repo") containing an existing Rails app called "RottenPotatoes", add a feature to the app, and deploy the result publicly on the Heroku platform. We will run live integration tests against your deployed version.

### Homework 3: Behavior-Driven Design ###
> In this homework you will create user stories to describe a feature of a SaaS app, use the Cucumber tool to turn those stories into executable acceptance tests, and run the tests against your SaaS app. Specifically, you will write Cucumber scenarios that test the happy paths of parts 1-3 of HW 2.

### Homework 4: BDD and TDD Cycle ###
> In this homework you will use the Cucumber and RSpec tools to add new functionality to a SaaS app. This functionality will be designed following the principles of Behavior-Driven Design (BDD) and developed following Test-Driven Development (TDD).
